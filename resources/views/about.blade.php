      <p> Hi! My name is Dimitrie Lauer and I am a freelance Camera-Operator and Learning Software Developer.</p>

      <p>I have started my camera journey when I was 15 years old. After 4 years of education on the "Curio College" I
        started working at EMG Nederland the biggest broadcast facilitatior in the Netherlands.</p>

      <p>Now after 3 years of working at EMG I have decided to become a Freelancer! If you are interested in my work
        check out the "My Work" page on this website!</p>

      <p> In 2022 I applied to the HZ University of Applied Science to study HBO-ICT witch I am studying right now!
        This web page is a starting project of mine in my first year.</p>

      <p> When I started working as a freelance camera-operator I also founded the company "DL Video-Registraties.
        This is the name I use when working as a camera-operator so you will
        see that coming around very often!
